    "The artificial neuron attempts to mimic the biological neuron and it also has inputs and outputs. Inputs will be values of features. The inputs will be multiplied by some sort of weights. Typically weights start off as random. Inputs are then multiplied by weights. Then we take these results that we obtained and pass it to an activation function. The final result will depend on the activation function. The model which has only one neuron as output is called perceptron.\n",

    "Note that the above is just an example and an actual perceptron may vary and can have more than the inputs shown above in the image. However, it is important to note that a perceptron will only have one output irrespective of the number of inputs and the type of activation function being used.\n",
