    "Machine Learning - Creating an algorithm, which a computer then uses to find a model that fits the data as best as possible. It makes very accurate predictions based on that. We don't give machine the instructions on how to find the model. We provide the machine with algorithms which give the machine directions on how to learn on it's own. A Machine learning algorithm is like a trial and error process. Each consecutive trial is as good as the previous one.\n",

    "1. Supervised Learning : It is about training an algorithm which resembles a teacher supervising her students. It has labelled data which means we know the output along with the input. The objective function is able to measure the inaccuracy since we know the labelled data. Optimization algorithm is used to improve the way algorithm is designed and improve the accuracy of the model. Supervision can be done only on the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unsupervised Learning : We might not have the time or the resources to train the dataset against the labelled data. In this case, unsupervised learning will be helpful. Here, unlabelled data will be provided to the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reinforcement Learning : Based on reward system. Instead of minimizing an error, we are maximizing the reward or optimization function."
