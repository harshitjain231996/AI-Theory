    "**Analytics** : Generally refers to the future. Instead of explaining past events, it explores the potential future events. Analytics is essentially the application of logical and computational reasoning to the component parts obtained in an analysis. In doing this, one is looking for patterns in exploring what one can do with them in the future.\n",

    "2. **Quantitative Analytics** - It's about applying formulas and algorithms to numbers one has gathered from the analysis.\n",

    "Example of Qualitative Analytics - An owner of an online clothing store is ahead of the competition and has a great understanding of the needs and wants of the customers. A detailed analysis has also been performed by the owner from articles about which fashion trends are followed. This can be used to decide which styles of clothing to sell. \n",

    "Example of Quantitative Analytics - Following the example above, the owner might not know when to introduce the new collection. In that case relying on past sales data and user experience data, the owner can predict which will be the best month to do so. "
